Our lab’s research in Maternal and Child Health, particularly concerning preterm birth, is employing multi-omics and wearable technology to deepen understanding and improve outcomes. Our lab is likely integrating data from these multi-omics analyses with information collected from wearable devices to create a comprehensive picture of maternal and fetal health. This integrated approach can identify patterns and risk factors associated with preterm birth and other pregnancy-related complications. Advanced data analysis techniques, including machine learning and AI, are used to analyze these complex datasets, aiming to develop predictive models for adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nMaternal and Child Health (MCH) is a critical public health domain focused on the health and well-being of mothers and children. Within this field, one significant area of concern is preterm birth, defined as the delivery of a baby before 37 weeks of gestation. Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and can have long-term impacts on health and development. Factors contributing to preterm birth are multifaceted, encompassing genetic, environmental, socioeconomic, and healthcare-related aspects.\nYour lab’s research in Maternal and Child Health, particularly concerning preterm birth, is employing multi-omics and wearable technology to deepen understanding and improve outcomes. Multi-omics, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics, offers a comprehensive approach to unraveling the complex biological mechanisms underlying pregnancy, including the risk factors and pathways leading to preterm birth. This approach allows for the identification of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.\nFor example, genomics can provide insights into genetic predispositions to preterm birth, while transcriptomics and proteomics can reveal changes in gene expression and protein levels associated with pregnancy complications. Metabolomics offers a snapshot of metabolic changes during pregnancy, and microbiomics sheds light on the role of the microbiome in maternal and fetal health.\nIn tandem, wearable technology is increasingly being utilized in MCH research. Wearables, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, can continuously monitor vital signs like heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical activity. More advanced wearables can track physiological parameters specific to pregnancy, such as uterine activity or fetal heart rate. This real-time monitoring can help in early detection of abnormalities, leading to timely interventions.\nYour lab is likely integrating data from these multi-omics analyses with information collected from wearable devices to create a comprehensive picture of maternal and fetal health.

During pregnancy, the maternal metabolome undergoes dramatic systemic changes, although correlating longitudinal changes in maternal urine remain largely unexplored. We applied an LCMS-based untargeted metabolomics profiling approach to analyze 346 longitudinal maternal urine samples collected throughout pregnancy for 36 women from diverse ethnic backgrounds with differing clinical characteristics. We detected 20,314 metabolic peaks and annotated 875 metabolites. Altered metabolites include a broad panel of glucocorticoids, lipids, and amino acid derivatives, which revealed systematic pathway alterations during pregnancy. We also developed a machine-learning model to precisely predict gestational age (GA) at time of sampling using urine metabolites that provides a non-invasive method for pregnancy dating. This longitudinal maternal urine study demonstrates the clinical utility of using untargeted metabolomics in obstetric settings.","tags":null,"title":"Longitudinal Urine Metabolic Profiling and

Here, we discovered a well-defined interface between the synaptic vesicle V-ATPase and synaptophysin by in situ cryo-electron tomography and single particle cryo-electron microscopy of functional synaptic vesicles isolated from mouse brains3. The synaptic vesicle V-ATPase is an ATP-dependent proton pump that establishes the protein gradient across the synaptic vesicle, which in turn drives the uptake of neurotransmitters4,5. Synaptophysin6 and its paralogs synaptoporin7 and synaptogyrin8 belong to a family of abundant synaptic vesicle proteins whose function is still unclear. We performed structural and functional studies of synaptophysin knockout mice, confirming the identity of synaptophysin as an interaction partner with the V-ATPase. Although there is little change in the conformation of the V-ATPase upon interaction with synaptophysin, the presence of synaptophysin in synaptic vesicles profoundly affects the copy number of V-ATPases. This effect on the topography of synaptic vesicles suggests that synaptophysin assists in their biogenesis. In support of this model, we observed that synaptophysin knockout mice exhibit severe seizure susceptibility, suggesting an imbalance of neurotransmitter release as a physiological consequence of the absence of synaptophysin.","tags":null,"title":"Structure and topography of the synaptic V-ATPase–synaptophysin complex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaotao SHEN"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1717246800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719839956,"objectID":"6ba5a6b19ebe3abf7c3b895255982bb6","permalink":"https://shen-lab.org/event/2024-asms/","publishdate":"2024-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2024-asms/","section":"event","summary":"Nonlinear Dynamic Changes During Human Aging Revealed in Multi-omics Profiles","tags":[],"title":"Nonlinear Dynamic Changes During Human Aging Revealed in Multi-omics Profiles","type":"event"},{"authors":["Xiaotao SHEN"],"categories":null,"content":"Our paper on the role of the gut microbiota in the host human health has been accepted for publication in Cell Host \u0026amp; Microbe.

Here we present novel machine learning frameworks for identifying common and rare disease-associated genetic variation, which outperform conventional approaches. By integrating single-cell multiomics profiling of human lungs to link genetic signals to cell-type-specific functions, we have discovered and validated over 1,000 risk genes underlying severe COVID-19 across 19 cell types. Identified risk genes are overexpressed in healthy lungs but relatively downregulated in severely diseased lungs. Genetic risk for severe COVID-19, within both common and rare variants, is particularly enriched in natural killer (NK) cells, which places these immune cells upstream in the pathogenesis of severe disease. Mendelian randomization indicates that failed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells leads to critical illness. Network analysis further links multiple pathways associated with NK cell activation, including type-I-interferon-mediated signalling, to severe COVID-19. Our rare variant model, PULSE, enables sensitive prediction of severe disease in non-elderly patients based on whole-exome sequencing; individualized predictions are accurate independent of age and sex, and are consistent across multiple populations and cohorts. Risk stratification based on exome sequencing has the potential to facilitate post-exposure prophylaxis in at-risk individuals, potentially based around augmentation of NK cell function.

The NGLY1 protein catalyzes the first step in protein deglycosylation, a process prerequisite for the cytosolic degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. By performing and combining metabolomics and proteomics profiles, we showed that NGLY1 deficiency induced the activation of immune response, disturbed lipid metabolism, biogenic amine synthesis and glutathione metabolism. The discovery was further validated by profiling of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which serve as a personalized cellular model of the disease. This study provides new insights into the NGLY1 deficiency pathology and demonstrates that the upregulation of immune response and downregulation of lipid metabolism appear to be important molecular phenotypes of NGLY1 deficiency, together with the dysregulation of amino acid metabolism, biogenic amine synthesis and diverse signaling pathways, likely causing broad downstream syndromes. Collectively, such valuable multi-omics profiles identified broad molecular associations of potential pathological mechanisms during the onset of NGLY1 deficiency and suggested potential therapeutic targets for researchers and clinicians.","tags":null,"title":"Integration and comparison of multi-omics profiles of NGLY1 deficiency plasma and cellular models to identify clinically relevant molecular phenotypes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiali Lv","Jialin Wang","Xiaotao SHEN","Jia Liu","Deli Zhao","Mengke Wei","Xia Li","Bingbing Fan","Yawen Sun","Fuzhong Xue","Prof. Zheng-Jiang Zhu","Tao Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719839956,"objectID":"fbe67d7259854f233b03028860283dba","permalink":"https://shen-lab.org/publication/a-serum-metabolomics-analysis-reveals-a-panel-of-screening-metabolic-biomarkers-for-esophageal-squamous-cell-carcinoma/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-serum-metabolomics-analysis-reveals-a-panel-of-screening-metabolic-biomarkers-for-esophageal-squamous-cell-carcinoma/","section":"publication","summary":"Dear Editor, Endoscopy with iodine staining was widely used for esophageal cancer (EC) screening in high-incidence area. 1, 2 Most endoscopy screening-positive population was found to develop esophageal epithelium lesion, and therefore endured higher risk for developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) than normal population. 3, 4 However, endoscopic screening may be too costly and invasive for large-scale population, and non-invasive biomarkers may be more applicable and cost effective for population-based screening. 5, 6 In this population-based screening study, we aim to identify potential metabolic biomarkers for early screening of ESCC, and establish the optimal early ESCC screening model.

To define a high-resolution temporal profile of metabolites during healthy pregnancy, we analyzed the untargeted metabolome of 784 weekly blood samples from 30 pregnant women. Broad changes and a highly choreographed profile were revealed: 4,995 metabolic features (of 9,651 total), 460 annotated compounds (of 687 total), and 34 human metabolic pathways (of 48 total) were significantly changed during pregnancy. Using linear models, we built a metabolic clock with five metabolites that time gestational age in high accordance with ultrasound (R = 0.92).

Here, we demonstrated the use of a machine-learning algorithm called support vector regression (SVR) to develop a prediction method that utilized 14 common molecular descriptors to predict CCS values for metabolites. In this work, we first experimentally measured CCS values (ΩN₂) of ∼400 metabolites in nitrogen buffer gas and used these values as training data to optimize the prediction method. The high prediction precision of this method was externally validated using an independent set of metabolites with a median relative error (MRE) of ∼3%, better than conventional theoretical calculation. Using the SVR based prediction method, a large-scale predicted CCS database was generated for 35 203 metabolites in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). For each metabolite, five different ion adducts in positive and negative modes were predicted, accounting for 176 015 CCS values in total.

Data acquisition of large-scale samples has to be divided into several batches and may span from months to as long as several years. The signal drift of metabolites during data acquisition (intra- and inter-batch) is unavoidable and is a major confounding factor for large-scale metabolomics studies. We aim to develop a data normalization method to reduce unwanted variations and integrate multiple batches in large-scale metabolomics studies prior to statistical analyses. We developed a machine learning algorithm-based method, support vector regression (SVR), for large-scale metabolomics data normalization and integration. An R package named MetNormalizer was …","tags":null,"title":"Normalization and integration of large-scale metabolomics data using support vector regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"— date: “2023-08-01” sections: - block: slider content: slides: - align: center background: color: ‘#666’ image: filename: coders.jpg filters: brightness: 0.7 position: right content: Take a look at what we’re working on… title: “\\U0001F44B Welcome to the group” - align: left background: color: ‘#555’ image: filename: contact.jpg filters: brightness: 0.7 position: center content: Share your knowledge with the group and explore exciting new topics together! title: Lunch \u0026amp; Learn ☕️ - align: right background: color: ‘#333’ image: filename: welcome.jpg filters: brightness: 0.5 position: center content: Just opened last month! link: icon: graduation-cap icon_pack: fas text: Join Us url: ../contact/ title: World-Class Semiconductor Lab design: interval: 2000 is_fullscreen: true loop: false slide_height: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; title: Tour type: landing — ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719839956,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://shen-lab.org/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"— date: “2023-08-01” sections: - block: slider content: slides: - align: center background: color: ‘#666’ image: filename: coders.jpg filters: brightness: 0.7 position: right content: Take a look at what we’re working on… title: “\\U0001F44B Welcome to the group” - align: left background: color: ‘#555’ image: filename: contact.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"}]
