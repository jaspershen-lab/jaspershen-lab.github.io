Genetic risk is particularly focused within natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, placing the dysfunction of these cells upstream of severe disease.

During pregnancy, the maternal metabolome undergoes dramatic systemic changes, although correlating longitudinal changes in maternal urine remain largely unexplored. We applied an LCMS-based untargeted metabolomics profiling approach to analyze 346 longitudinal maternal urine samples collected throughout pregnancy for 36 women from diverse ethnic backgrounds with differing clinical characteristics. We detected 20,314 metabolic peaks and annotated 875 metabolites. Altered metabolites include a broad panel of glucocorticoids, lipids, and amino acid derivatives, which revealed systematic pathway alterations during pregnancy. We also developed a machine-learning model to precisely predict gestational age (GA) at time of sampling using urine metabolites that provides a non-invasive method for pregnancy dating. This longitudinal maternal urine study demonstrates the clinical utility of using untargeted metabolomics in obstetric settings.","tags":null,"title":"Longitudinal Urine Metabolic Profiling and Gestational Age Prediction in Pregnancy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaotao Shen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654434000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700697544,"objectID":"cbce9d8988c98e948024705da6ecbf25","permalink":"https://shen-lab.org/event/2022-asms/","publishdate":"2022-06-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2022-asms/","section":"event","summary":"Tidymass An Object-oriented Computational Framework for LC-MS Data Processing and Analysis","tags":[],"title":"Tidymass An Object-oriented Computational Framework for LC-MS Data Processing and Analysis","type":"event"},{"authors":["Prof. Peng Gao","Xiaotao Shen","Xinyue Zhang","Chao Jiang","Prof. Sai Zhang","Dr. Xin Zhou","Sophia Miryam Sch√ºssler-Fiorenza Rose","Prof. Michael Snyder"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700551757,"objectID":"4a575b56fec0fd6fd2edc80b4fbd6e93","permalink":"https://shen-lab.org/publication/precision-environmental-health-monitoring-by-longitudinal-exposome-and-multi-omics-profiling/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/precision-environmental-health-monitoring-by-longitudinal-exposome-and-multi-omics-profiling/","section":"publication","summary":"Conventional environmental health studies have primarily focused on limited environmental stressors at the population level, which lacks the power to dissect the complexity and heterogeneity of individualized environmental exposures. Here, as a pilot case study, we integrated deep-profiled longitudinal personal exposome and internal multi-omics to systematically investigate how the exposome shapes a single individual's phenome. We annotated thousands of chemical and biological components in the personal exposome cloud and found they were significantly correlated with thousands of internal biomolecules, which was further cross-validated using corresponding clinical data.

Here we present novel machine learning frameworks for identifying common and rare disease-associated genetic variation, which outperform conventional approaches. By integrating single-cell multiomics profiling of human lungs to link genetic signals to cell-type-specific functions, we have discovered and validated over 1,000 risk genes underlying severe COVID-19 across 19 cell types. Identified risk genes are overexpressed in healthy lungs but relatively downregulated in severely diseased lungs. Genetic risk for severe COVID-19, within both common and rare variants, is particularly enriched in natural killer (NK) cells, which places these immune cells upstream in the pathogenesis of severe disease. Mendelian randomization indicates that failed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells leads to critical illness. Network analysis further links multiple pathways associated with NK cell activation, including type-I-interferon-mediated signalling, to severe COVID-19. Our rare variant model, PULSE, enables sensitive prediction of severe disease in non-elderly patients based on whole-exome sequencing; individualized predictions are accurate independent of age and sex, and are consistent across multiple populations and cohorts. Risk stratification based on exome sequencing has the potential to facilitate post-exposure prophylaxis in at-risk individuals, potentially based around augmentation of NK cell function.

The NGLY1 protein catalyzes the first step in protein deglycosylation, a process prerequisite for the cytosolic degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. By performing and combining metabolomics and proteomics profiles, we showed that NGLY1 deficiency induced the activation of immune response, disturbed lipid metabolism, biogenic amine synthesis and glutathione metabolism. The discovery was further validated by profiling of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which serve as a personalized cellular model of the disease. This study provides new insights into the NGLY1 deficiency pathology and demonstrates that the upregulation of immune response and downregulation of lipid metabolism appear to be important molecular phenotypes of NGLY1 deficiency, together with the dysregulation of amino acid metabolism, biogenic amine synthesis and diverse signaling pathways, likely causing broad downstream syndromes. Collectively, such valuable multi-omics profiles identified broad molecular associations of potential pathological mechanisms during the onset of NGLY1 deficiency and suggested potential therapeutic targets for researchers and clinicians.","tags":null,"title":"Integration and comparison of multi-omics profiles of NGLY1 deficiency plasma and cellular models to identify clinically relevant molecular phenotypes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiali Lv","Jialin Wang","Xiaotao Shen","Jia Liu","Deli Zhao","Mengke Wei","Xia Li","Bingbing Fan","Yawen Sun","Fuzhong Xue","Prof. Zheng-Jiang Zhu","Tao Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700551757,"objectID":"fbe67d7259854f233b03028860283dba","permalink":"https://shen-lab.org/publication/a-serum-metabolomics-analysis-reveals-a-panel-of-screening-metabolic-biomarkers-for-esophageal-squamous-cell-carcinoma/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-serum-metabolomics-analysis-reveals-a-panel-of-screening-metabolic-biomarkers-for-esophageal-squamous-cell-carcinoma/","section":"publication","summary":"Dear Editor, Endoscopy with iodine staining was widely used for esophageal cancer (EC) screening in high-incidence area. 1, 2 Most endoscopy screening-positive population was found to develop esophageal epithelium lesion, and therefore endured higher risk for developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) than normal population. 3, 4 However, endoscopic screening may be too costly and invasive for large-scale population, and non-invasive biomarkers may be more applicable and cost effective for population-based screening. 5, 6 In this population-based screening study, we aim to identify potential metabolic biomarkers for early screening of ESCC, and establish the optimal early ESCC screening model.

The samples were collected from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) from July 2014 to January 2016. Statistical methods, such as partial least squares (PLS) and Wilcoxon rank-sum test, were used to identify discriminative metabolites between NCRT-sensitive and NCRT-resistant patients according to their tumor regression grade (TRG).

However, the prediction precision is not sufficient to differentiate lipids due to their high structural similarities and subtle differences on CCS values. To address this challenge, we developed a new approach, namely, LipidCCS, to precisely predict lipid CCS values.

However, metabolite identification remains a major analytical challenge for untargeted metabolomics. While the use of collision cross-section (CCS) values obtained in ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) effectively increases identification confidence of metabolites, it is restricted by the limited number of available CCS values for metabolites. Here, we demonstrated the use of a machine-learning algorithm called support vector regression (SVR) to develop a prediction method that utilized 14 common molecular descriptors to predict CCS values for metabolites. In this work, we first experimentally measured CCS values (Œ©N‚ÇÇ) of ‚àº400 metabolites in nitrogen buffer gas and used these values as training data to optimize the prediction method. The high prediction precision of this method was externally validated using an independent set of metabolites with a median relative error (MRE) of ‚àº3%, better than conventional theoretical calculation. Using the SVR based prediction method, a large-scale predicted CCS database was generated for 35‚ÄØ203 metabolites in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). For each metabolite, five different ion adducts in positive and negative modes were predicted, accounting for 176‚ÄØ015 CCS values in total. Finally, improved metabolite identification accuracy was demonstrated using real biological samples. Conclusively, our results proved that the SVR based prediction method can accurately predict nitrogen CCS values (Œ©N‚ÇÇ) of metabolites from molecular descriptors and effectively improve ‚Ä¶","tags":null,"title":"Large-Scale Prediction of Collision Cross-Section Values for Metabolites in Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaotao Shen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1469192400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700697544,"objectID":"e9f535ba3604261bb307752b6260e39c","permalink":"https://shen-lab.org/event/2016-asms/","publishdate":"2016-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2016-asms/","section":"event","summary":"Normalization and Integration of Large-Scale Mass Spectrometry-based Metabolomics Data Using Support Vector Regression","tags":[],"title":"Normalization and Integration of Large-Scale Mass Spectrometry-based Metabolomics Data Using Support Vector Regression","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jialin Wang","Tao Zhang","Xiaotao Shen","Jia Liu","Deli Zhao","Yawen Sun","Lu Wang","Yingjun Liu","Xiaoyun Gong","Yanxun Liu","Zheng-Jiang Zhu","Fuzhong Xue"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1466640000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700551757,"objectID":"498531f1fa7912a0de7e00561e512cc6","permalink":"https://shen-lab.org/publication/serum-metabolomics-for-early-diagnosis-of-esophageal-squamous-cell-carcinoma-by-uhplc-qtof/","publishdate":"2016-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/serum-metabolomics-for-early-diagnosis-of-esophageal-squamous-cell-carcinoma-by-uhplc-qtof/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction Previous metabolomics studies have revealed perturbed metabolic signatures in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients, however, most of these studies included mainly late-staged ESCC patients due to the difficulties of collecting the early-staged samples from asymptotic ESCC subjects.
